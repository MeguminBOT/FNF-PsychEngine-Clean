These tools are simply used for collecting players system info and device specs.
This is to make support easier for devs when issues are reported.

----- IMPORTANT -----
This ONLY collects the following:

* Operating System
* Hardware used (CPU, GPU, RAM)
* GPU Driver version

It will never collect any personal data, if you're feeling uneasy, you can check the source code here:
